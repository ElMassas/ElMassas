#### Check out my personal projects:

- [Community-work](https://github.com/ElMassas/community-work). A small website to list ONGs working in Portugal, so that those who want to help their communities can come to the website and find the most suited option for them.

- [base.gottem.pt](https://github.com/ElMassas/base.gottem.pt). Not made public yet, but the idea is to audit the public contracts made by the Portuguese government and make the data more easy to digest for everyone

- [My personal use dockerfiles](https://github.com/ElMassas/dockerfiles). Dockerfiles I use to test and deploy services in both a professional and recreational environment

- [Grafana Stack](https://github.com/ElMassas/Grafana-stack). Playing around with the full grafana observability stack, so as to be used to quickly and easily be set up.  Needs some improvement

#### Future projects:

- Personal website
- Automated way to post in multiple social networks at the same time;
- Bot that checks Portuguese national assembly votes which are made public in the assembly's website in a PDF format and share them in a more digestible format in multiple social networks at the same time;
- Terraform module to create github repositories in a more templated fashion. Currently if you create a github template, it won't actually use everything setting and change you've done to the repositories, which is annoying.
- Website focused on teaching about personal security and privacy for activists, journalists and alike.
- Personal dotfiles
